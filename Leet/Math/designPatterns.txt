# System Design:

(1) Dependencies between modules in program
  - how would expand project
  - share libraries/components
  - ways to break up program into components
  - classes in program
(2) Simplicity/One-Way Data Flow
  - Controller, View, Data Objects
  - Each class has single responsibility*
